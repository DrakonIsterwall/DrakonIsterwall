ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of different stuff in CyberSec like TryHackme,started with HacktheBox(more on TryHackMe) ,Github.Mainly looking through repos and trying to find something that suits me,rented some different VPS to improve in Linux terminal and Docker.

ðŸ“« Im planning to add in future some more interesting things into my daily activities like Bug Bounty Hunting and more, buying some Linux and other Basic Books,writing write ups for TryHackMe or python course.
   
âš¡ Gonna try to update this README as much as i can :)Â Added a TryHackMe repo and gonna add my finished rooms over time, how i solved them.
